# ETF Analyzer
For now, this is just a simple ETF analyzer to help quickly get an overview of how selected ETFs are performing.
Thanks to the *pyinvest* module, which relies on Investing.com to provide data, it supports ETFs in most markets.

Perhaps in the future it could be used to scan for new ETFs worth analyzing! (High % growth, low volatility anyone?)
